<h1>Underworld Adventures</h1>

<p>
Welcome to the Underworld Adventures home page. Underworld Adventures is a project to recreate Ultima Underworld 1 on modern operating systems (e.g. Win32, Linux or MacOS), using the original game files. It uses OpenGL for 3D graphics, the SDL library for platform specific tasks and Lua for scripting. It is developed as Open Source and is licensed under the GNU General Public License.

  I'm sorry to say that the current status of the Underworld Adventures project is "inactive".
  I didn't find enough time in the last few months and years to productively work on the
  project. Another thing that slowed me down a bit is the fact that it should be possible
  without much work to get Ultima Underworld 1 and 2 to run on Windows XP and later (via the
  proper settings), using DosBox under non-Windows operating systems, or with using VMware
  (Player) to emulate the old operating systems.

  Nevertheless Underworld Adventures was a fun project and I learned much about open source
  development, licenses, people, doing script and graphics programming. Hope you enjoyed trying
  the early versions of Underworld Adventures!
