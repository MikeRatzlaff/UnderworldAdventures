   Worked on the tilemap view and improved rendering. Drawing the diagonal tiles is painfully slow, though (GDI polygons). Here's a screenshot:

   Clicking on any tile in the view lets you view the tile info. The button teleports the player to the new position (makes hotspot list almost useless). Later the objects in the current tile should be listed in the empty box below the tile's data. Each object should get it's 16x16 icon from the game, and object properties can then be edited in another dockable window for "object properties".

   You can also see David Bowen's Tabbed MDI window magic. It has a tab for any MDI (non-dockable windows) that are in the app's working area. Unfortunately Sergey Klimov's Docking framework doesn't quite work together with the tabbing framework. And the XP style menu of course doesn't work together with all other frameworks. Oh well ...

   Improved RSS output a bit, Feedreader had some problems with RFC 822 dates without correct time. Also added a limiter so that html output is limited to the last 10 items, and RSS is limited to the last 8. I guess good RSS aggregators store the older articles somewhere.

   Worked on the debugger's object list docking window (which should probably be a full MDI view) today, but it isn't finished yet. It is planned that values changed between two updates are drawn with red background. Editing values also still don't work. It is planned that the object list is more an "advanced" view for the real hacker. Object placement and modification should normally done using the tilemap viewer and some "object property sheet". It may even be good to do some wizard to accomplish more complex tasks, such as a "Place Trap Wizard".

   I'm currently working (for the last month or so) on a new Underworld Adventures Debugger implementation using <a href="http://wtl.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">WTL</a> as UI library. This way I get much quicker to what I have planned to do. I've also done a "uastudio" project that basically is a cut-down uwadv executable that only contains the game engine, needed classes and runs the game's main loop. It additionally starts the debugger. "uastudio" is the "Underworld Adventures Studio" application and helps me to quickly develop the new uadebug.dll. Additionally to the debugger I'm extending the ua_debug_server_interface interface to extract the needed infos. I've done some screenshots to show off what I've done so far. Click on them to show the larger version.

   This is the game strings view. The shown text block can be selected with the combo box, and the list just shows the strings. The little black squares are newlines that should be replaced with \n soon. In general you have a menu bar (with cool XP style menus, yeah!) and a toolbar (technically a command bar). Notable is the "play" button which can suspend and resume the game loop in the game. You only will be allowed to change values when the engine is stopped. Next to the button are the ugly designed buttons that enable all the goodies the debugger can view. First one is "player info", then comes "object list", "hotspot list", "tilemap view" and "gamestrings view". If someone has better icons, just send them!

   Shot 2 shows the tilemap viewer. It's still in the making, and it only shows the first map of the level (level map management will be added soon). Later you will be able to click on a square and see/modify its tile type, height, wall, ceiling and door textures. It is also planned to add an object editor into this view, so that objects can be conveniently placed.

   <a href="index.php?page=image&amp;image=/devel/uadebug03.png&amp;text=Lua source file editor"><img src="/devel/uadebug03.jpg" alt="lua source file editor"/></a><br/>
   Shot 3 shows the Lua source file editor. The window uses <a href="http://www.scintilla.org" target="_blank">Scintilla</a> for editing and syntax highlighting. When Lua code debugging is built in (this has to wait a bit), you can set breakpoints on the gray area to the left, just like in Visual Studio. A "project" pane that docks to the left side is also planned. It lists all Lua files that a "game" currently has loaded.

   <a href="index.php?page=image&amp;image=/devel/uadebug04.png&amp;text=Hotspot list and player info"><img src="/devel/uadebug04.jpg" alt="hotspot list and player info"/></a><br/>
   Finally, shot 4 shows the hotspot list and the player info, with no main window open. This means you certainly need more than a 800x600 screen resolution to conveniently work with uadebug. Player info even allows changing values, so modifying the "maplevel" teleports you to another level, and changing "xpos" and "ypos" moves you around in the level. Not very usable in uastudio, though :)

I modified the devlog so that devlog entries are stored in an xml file and the web output is done using an xsl-transformation. At least that was my initial thought. SF doesn't directly support that, so I had to use the expat parser, which registers callback functions for elements. The handlers then output html code. It's more limited than xsl-transformations, but it suffices for what I want to do here. I've also done RSS 2.0 output so that everyone with an RSS aggregator can read the devlog. I then tried SharpReader and Amphetadesk. The results look ok, but both aggregators seem to have problems with the embedded html code, so links won't show up, and other small problems. Also the pubDate field isn't formatted correctly as in RFC 822, but I'm too lazy to do that now.

Flushing out stdout and stderr when an ua_assert condition is false. This helps in debugging when the output files at least have *some* output. Worked on improving decompiling conversation code all day and it really gets nice. The opcodes are first put in a "graph" with different graph item types, the first being "opcode". Opcodes are then examined, function starts and ends are added, and additional "expression" and "operator" items are put in, too. Processed opcodes are marked done. Operators consume zero or more expressions and may yield no or one expression. Expressions are things like local variable value or pointer to memory location. They can have the attribute "value-of" and "address-of".
  </para>
  <para>
In the next step operations search their needed expression from the graph and combine them to new expressions or a new type of graph item, a statement. The statement doesn't need expressions and doesn't yield one. The items are properly inserted in the graph and used items are marked done. Dumping the graph then shows the work already done on the graph. Currently there are only some opcodes left that are rarely used. And control structures like "if", "while" and "switch" aren't put in yet. Another problem is with temporary local variables that are set and directly used in function calls then (in conv. code all parameters are passed by-reference). The function call is inserted before all temporary parameters are set, but this should be easily fixed.

Removed section support in ua_cfgfile, moved uw1 files check to ua_gamecfg file reader. Enhanced game strings loading by only loading string blocks "on demand", e.g. when a string in a block not available is requested. Blocks have a "lifetime" counter and some blocks are never paged out again, e.g. the block 1 with strings that are commonly used. The loader supports loading from multiple SDL_RWops structures now. Splitted basic methods of the ua_game_interface into ua_basic_game_interface, which lacks stuff not needed, e.g. for the debugger or when building an "Underworld Adventures Studio" application. Scripting now also only gets an ua_basic_game_interface pointer. Audio playlist is loaded via ua_cfgfile now. Updated player info list in uadebug to show player values again.

Changed quadtree class to have a callback function that is called when a visible tile is encountered. Fixed a bug in quadtree class where tiles at the frustum edges were not collected properly. Started to rework object and critter rendering.

During winter holiday I chose to examine uw.exe further. It's interesting how the Looking Glass team built Ultima Underworld. They used Turbo C++ 1.01 (or 1.0) (available for free now at the <a href="http://community.borland.com/museum/" target="_blank">borland museum</a> for programming, but no C++ features. Some modules were compiled for overlaying (switch -Y); Turbo C++ uses Borland's VROOM (?) engine for swapping in/out code segments when code calls some functions in other overlaid modules. This time the uw team could save much conventional memory space. The segments seem to be stored in EMS memory. I played around with decompiling uw.exe with <a href="http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~cristina/dcc.html" target="_blank">dcc</a>, but because of the calls "outside" the normal memory space into the overlay manager it obviously failed. Additionally the engine loaded the wrong library sigs (Borland 3 was identified). The decompiler engine looks promising, though, but isn't actively developed anymore.

Another thing I'm looking forward to do is to improve critter animation frames loading. Currently it takes almost forever compared to the last release.

Finally figured out the place where npc variables are stored in the conversation memory for use as "imported globals". Could guess quite some npc_* variables in the npc data area. I recently modified uwadv that the "zpos" field is stored as a double - seems that I have to change this field back to int, since some traps uses the field. The same with "xpos" and "ypos" fields. And it seems that tilemaps store the floor height in a lower bit resolution than used in the game, only using 5 bits. They are shifted left to use 7 bits ingame, just as the normal item's "zpos" field also has.

Found out more stuff using uwdump and the decoded uw.exe:<br/>
* the speaking door in level 6 (tile coords=04/02) is hard-wired in the uw.exe; a temporary npc object is allocated and the npc_whoami field is filled with the conv. slot of the door<br/>
* a common function for link field extraction for tilemap index, normal chain links and special links are used, since the fields all have the same bit positions (bits 6..15 of a 16-bit integer value)<br/>
* uw seems to use a simple random number generator (don't know if it's the runtime library's one) with the equation rand = (rand_last * 0x015a4e35)+1

Modified the master object list in the underworld debugger to hold all values in a string array, in spite of getting every value from the game itself when the list control has to be updated. The user has to "update" the list to be the current one when editing it. Reordered columns. Unfortunately I cannot catch a double-click on a particular list cell (e.g. to jump to a linked object). Added a AddFrameMenus() method to the main frame window to set common menus to child frames. Added menu items for the master object list frame to save object list to a .csv file, and added the possibility to change the level of which the object list is shown.

  <para>
I changed back the return types of all handle_event() and mouse_action() methods, since it didn't really make sense to have the info if the event was handled. Also added saving of ua_object objects to also store inventory objects easily. In Lua, the real npc variable names (e.g. "npc_xhome", etc.) are set instead of using a "data" array. For this I have to find out most of the important variables in the npc info, though. Disabled the inventory items placed into inventory for release builds. Added inventory saving. Fixed conversations, not that we don't have a "data" array. Fixed Lua dump_objinfo_table() function. Wow, done a lot this day!

Finished savegame screen today, although the user cannot scroll when more than 17 savegames are displayed (hmm, maybe the up/down buttons from the inventory could be reused).

The debugger interface and underworld access API classes now get tick() calls every tick to process debug stuff on the main game loop thread. This was necessary to reload all textures when the map level is changed from the debugger. OpenGL can only work with the resource context when it's used from the same thread that it created. Other uses would be a "notify" system that "sends" messages back to the debugger, e.g. when a breakpoint is released. The debugger then could "query" a stack or deque of "events" from the main game thread.

Had the chance to try uwadv on a Diamond FireGL 1000 Pro card (seems to be manufactured 1998 or so). It's an AGP card and has 8MB memory. In windowed modes textures are very blurry and tiled textures have very obvious seams. According to the OpenGL stats it only supports 128x128 sized textures in this mode (but 16 light sources - my current card even can't do that). In Fullscreen mode things are slightly better - textures up to 512x512. Frame rate is still bad. 5 fps at the animated underworld logo and about 6 fps in the first hallway.

Replaced the way the debugger accessed infos of the underworld object with a new one. The old one was done using a class, and that wasn't that portable between msvc and mingw.

It can be given a command, a command type and two in/out-parameters using a union inside a struct (should be portable enough).

Added resampling code for the .voc files to resample from 12048 Hz to 22050 Hz (actually, 22088 Hz). The reason for this was that the SDL_mixer base sample rate was at 12000 Hz, which caused ogg vorbis files to play back too slow.
