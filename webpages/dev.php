<h3>plans</h3>

<p>
Development is divided into several steps: First, a rather exact remake should be done of the game. The design specification is the original game itself. An alternative game user interface is also planned. A visual "Underworld Debugger" is created during the project, to help developers creating the game. When all game features are in and bugs are fixed, a first release can be done.
</p>

<p>
The Second step would be to integrate Ultima Underworld 2, as it's very similar. When that is completed, a second release can be done.
</p>

<p>
A third possible step would be to create a "Exult Studio"-like application that allows to create new games in the style of the Ultima Underworlds.
</p>

<p>
Extensions to Underworld Adventures could be 3D objects and models that replace the 2D sprites used in the game. Another possibility would be digital sound effects and a digitally remastered soundtrack.
