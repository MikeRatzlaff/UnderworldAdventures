2002-07-24 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * did teach myself php over converting zzip-doc.pl into zzip-doc.php
 * added php-test and another way to create the docbook file, with php
	
2002-07-20 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * lots of fixes around docbook/manpage - and generate a zziplib.3
	overview page. Fixes also lots of comments in the sources.
 * modified fopen-mode interpration nicely.
 * added zzip-api for full overview of the zzip's API

2002-07-19 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * greatly enhanced docbook/manpage generation - including to attach
	author and license info from the respective source file header
	
2002-07-18 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * extended the perlscript to generate zziplib.docbook
 * use xmlto to generated manpages.ar
 * install-man3 target and push into rpm-devel package
	
2002-07-17 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * no new code, just doc updates. The perl-script is now capable to
	combine _ext_io functions with their non-ext/io cousin, and the
	sources have been modified to honour this new mode. 
 * the perl-script is now ready to spit out other data like docbook
	files that we can generate man-pages from later.

2002-07-16 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * extern-C in SDL_rwops_zzip.h ... and ifdef'able DECLSPEC for staticlinking
 * zzip_fopen allows to greatly simplify SDL_rwops_zzip.c
 * zzxordir.c zzxorcat.c zzxorcopy.c invented
 * lots of new documentation added
	zzip-extio.html zzip-xor.html zzip-refs.html
 * new checks that test the zzxor examples
 * and found an zzxor bug in the course
	
2002-07-15 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * Michael-dot-Fink-at-asamnet-dot-de did some code review while 
	going after a specialty he wanted to do with the libs, and therefore..
 * PREFERZIP did never test real file - stupid bug, inverted logic....
 * add ZIPONLY zzipmode - we have plenty of options availabe... on 32bit
	platforms however, since I want to keep with the access-bits in 
	the lower parts.
	
2002-07-12 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * watcom-c-10.5 project file added
 * used my old watcom compiler to debug the win32 problems, and it turned
	out to be a mismatch in proccall for zlib - while the default in
	zlib.h inferred WINAPI, it turned out that zlib114dll.zip had in
	fact been compiled with __syscall procframe callmethod. Duh!!!
 * some things had to be rearranged in header files - most classically it
	seems that this compiler does not support __inline in C mode.

2002-07-11 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * convert all API const types into those with _zzip_const and use new
	types like zzip_char_t and zzip_strings_t throughout the sources.
 * add ZZIP_RDONLY and friends. Do not use fcntl bits anymore, and limit
	use routines to convert them into O_DEFs later one in the next
	version of this lib - here we just declare them to be their O_DEFs
	but code should start to pick up ZZIP_DEFs in the meantime.
 * add zzip_fopen and friends as another type of magic wrappers.
 * modify open_ext_io to use receive separate arguments for the two
	zzip extraflags - use these from now on, the others are just
	for limited backward compatibility.
 * modify all _close functions to return "int".

2002-07-10 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * Marlin Prowell mbp-at-cadalog-inc-dot-com did hit a problem on FreeBSD
	showing off a config problem - the configure.ac macro for off_t is
	written to be _undefined_ if off_t existed in the system. Instead we
	chose to defined zzip_off_t into a "long" as it is needed on win32,
	and since FreeBSD on LFP32 uses OFF64 it did fall flat on calls to
	lseek - without io-wrap the gcc did cast them correctly, so it worked.
 * the fix: use off_t if zzip_off_t undefined. Add a define zzip_off_t into
	long in conf-msvc.h. Add a configure-option to have wrappers for the
	default lowlevel calls as suggested by Marlin but I choose to have
	them off by default - a bsd ports package may start using it.
 * there have not been reported problems in the last three months where only
	developers knew about the new version. Guess it's time to push this
	tarball and announce it on freshmeat.
	
2002-04-30 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * fix typo in zzip-zip.c: __USE_MMAP -> _USE_MMAP
 * if zlib.h not found, make it a fatal exit

2002-04-25 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * adding a few more `make check` rules for bigger zip files
 * add even negative tests
 * add some spaces in error-messaging in zzdir.c and let return
	an exitcode when some argument files could not be read
	
2002-04-24 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * apply patch from Mike Nordell
	changes all "const char * *" into the intended "const char * const *"
	changes some typecasts
	corrects comment and adds some
	and two fixes
 * put the updated MSVC6 files into the project, again Mike Nordell
 * me, add new zzwrap.dsp to DIST in Makefile.am, following Mike's addition
 * me, modify some typecasts to use off_t/size_t where apropriate
 * modified COPYING.ZZIP to be a bit more general than just for ZZIPLIB
	as noted by Tomi Olilla
 * zzipwrap demo_callback, how can we do void* and char* at the same time...
	
2002-04-23 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * changed ssize_t into int in zzipwrap-mem for portability reasons
 * fix zzip_dir_fdopen_ext for access to uninitialized io-vtable
	(thanks to Lutz Sammer johns98-at-web-dot-de for testing)

2002-04-22 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * add MSVC6 project files contributed by Mike Nordell tamlin-at-algonet-dot-se
 * add plugin_io-patch from Mike Nordell
 	and dump the iowrap-patch from Andreas Shiffler from earlier release
 * append the Mike Nordell's zzobfuscated.c to Makefile.am
 * add a new file COPYING for new less-strictly license
	after Tomi Ollila has transferred full copyright to me
 * remove Tomi Ollila from all copyright entries in the sources
	but honour his name where apropriate
 * modify LGPL hints in sources and point to COPYING.ZZIP as well
        and change copyright year info
 * create COPYING.ZZIP with some general LGPL exceptions.
 * use newer AC_CREATE_CONFIG_H macro and start using acinclude.m4
	to allow retooling of the project.
 * and use zzip_off_t instead of ZZIP_off_t (but keep backward compatibility)
 * apply patch for the problem detected and corrected by 
	 Steve Dillon steved-at-phone-IVR-dot-com
 * try with an updated ac_create_prefix_config_h due to a bug report by
	John W. O'Brien john-at-jugglers-dot.com
   where his shell-and-echo combination did interpret \\1 twice.
 * add use_mmap flag to plugin_io_t, so the feature can be used
	along USE_MMAP configured setups
 * change USE_MMAP #ifdefs to use if()s and to rely on the
	compiler to do code removal for unreachable code
 * remove tell() part of plugin_io and rename seek()-indirection
	to seeks()-indirection using a tells()-macro in zzip-file
 * also rename s/seek/seeks/ in zzip-zip and kill the (*function)(x)
	for the indirection functions into just function(x)-calls
 * fix zzobfuscated example code - there's no read() without unistd.h
	in unix, and global zzip_install_io had been removed lately.
 * add zzipwrap-io.c and zzipwrap.c from Andreas Schiffler's patch
	on the new ground of Mike Nordell's plugin_io
 * modify zzipwrap sources to work with plugin-io
 * add io pointer to dir-structure, and use it as the default for file-structs
 * __zzip_open_zip is called __zzip_try_open now and takes two arguments
 * typedef struct zzip_plugin_io * zzip_plugin_io_t;
 * zzip_opendir_ext_io .. for magic convenience
 * create new zzipwrap.la in Makefile.am
 * move plugin_io struct from zziplib.h to zzip-io.h
	along with its helper functions
 * change all filesize into zzip_off_t
 * s/zzip_find_disk_trailer/__zzip_find_disk_trailer/ (additional io arg)
 * s/zzip_parse_root_directory/__zzip_parse_root_directory/ (ditto)

2001-10-11 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * added zzipwrap feature contributed by Andreas Schiffler
	
2001-09-18 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * fix bug for `zzip-config --cflags` 
	which did print /xx/include instead of -I/xx/include 
	(thanks to Roger Ostrander <denor(at)yahoo.com>)
 * change the for-loop in zzip-config - the "for i ; do" is not portable
	because I had problems on solaris-sh. Use "$@" which expands
	to a list (!!) of argv entries for this for-loop even for
	arguments that contain spaces. fascinating.
 * use AC_HELP_STRING ... the `configure --help` screen got a bit 
	misformatted lately.
 * add a `make check` rule.

2001-08-19 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * add that /programs magic to the $prefix check in configure.ac
 * add that /usr/share magic to the $prefix check in configure.ac
 * fix zzip-sdl-rwops.html layout (and copying.zlib link).
 * fix some flaws in sdl-rwops example source (just by code review).
 * add unistd.h include to zziptest.c to silence off the warning about sleep
 * add non-dll compile to extern in zzip-conf.h - does that fix anything?

2001-08-18 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * SDL_rwops_zzip.c/SDL_rwops_zzip.h SDL-example file.
 * change all filename args to be const
 * add ZZIP_const to zzip-conf.h, but do not use it for now. 
	It seems that all current lib-users have a modern compiler...

2001-08-16 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * export zzip_dir_free / zzip_dir_alloc
 * bring in fileext field to check for multiple fileextensions.
 * make zzip_open check for multiple (default) fileextensions.
 * add ifdef USE_ZZIPLIKES to implement feature proposed by
	Julien Cayzac <deepmind(at)jessica.brainlex.com>
 * make zzip_open check along the dirpath for a zip-file
	a feature proposed by Lutz Sammer <Johns98(at)web.de>

2001-08-15 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * add "stroustrup" style to all c files to ensure that casual
	developers do not trash the layout unintentionally.
 * modify examples a bit with more newlines / comments.
 * re-license examples to ZLIB license
 * include COPYING.ZLIB into doc_FILES
	
2001-08-10 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * change frontpage of webpages - including a few crosslinks to
	other projects

2001-08-07 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * split version X.Y.Z into -relese X -version-info Y:Z
 * adding --disable-thread-safe, and add -thread-safe linkage by default
 * modify releaseinfo for with-debug
 * install-zip target to make a windows package
 * change serial to _vendor - rpm has never been used for other than linux

2001-08-06 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * reorganize docs, update docs to new style
 * split version X.Y.Z into -release X.Y -version-info Z

2001-08-05 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * add zzip-msvc.h, a header file that will be included when
	a windows compiler is detected in zzip-conf.h, e.g.
	_MSC_VER or __BORLANDC__
 * mv index.html zzip-index.html and add makerule that patches
	the VERSION in before installing it as index.html
 * add a makerule to build sourceforge htdocs and add it
	to the rpm build.
 * add generic patches for libtool into configure.ac

2001-07-18 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * check up bugs in automake 1.4beef, now using a rule to
	override AUTO* in non-maintainer-mode. we also set
	libtool to silent in non-maintainer-mode
 * docs are installed to $datadir/doc/$package as default
 * rpms can now be built.
 * create --with-docdir and let it be filled in rpm-configure
	so that docs will end up where rpmopt says it should.
 * ChangeLog goes into %doc of rpms.
 * uhmm, forgot to install the test*.c files into the docdir
 * the bin rpms had not been built
 * compress into base and devel package
 * errnolist should be static

2001-07-17 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * nuke Makerule system, use plain autotools style including
	configure && make install to rebuild
 * update Makefile.am (which is new now)
 * use next-generation autotools as a basis, update configure.ac
	to newer style, update configscreen at the end of file
 * check perl in configure and let it default to "echo"
 * check HAVE_ defines coming from config.h - it is not anymore
	included by zzip-config.h, so each config-def usage
	must now use the prefix'd version
 * provide a zziplib.spec file

2001-01-05 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * apply zzip_seek-patch from Ted [sourceforge.net/users/tam4]
 * -> 0.10.12

2001-01-02 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * gone through a couple of trial and error versions until
	I finally arrived at a mingw32msvc zzip.dll - basically
	I had to update the included libtool files to 1.3.5
	and the zzip.dll source-files have a ZZIP_DLL define
	before the first include that points to zzip-conf.h -
	and there is the magic about dllexport and dllimport.
	Hopefully the same can run under MSVC without further
	changes to the sources.
 * try to package a zip-file that contains the relevant files
	from the mingw32msvc install, so that windows user
	get a clean dll without the need to compile it.
 * -> 0.10.11
	
2001-01-01 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * received a patch for MSVC compatibility from Ted A. (@lehigh.edu)
   which made me to look after the project again. There
   were two support requrest during summer that asked for
   MSVC support, especially a prebuilt dll and headers.
 * added AC_PREFIX_CONFIG_H that I made originally for
   another project. It enables me to push the configure
   detections into a global include/-dir. Ted's patch
   used an `IFDEF MSVC DEFINE HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H` which
   is a symptom of using config.h&HAVE_CONFIG_H and
   zzip-file.h&IFDEF HAVE_xx. Change all header-IFDEF-HAVE
   to use IFDEF-ZZIP_HAVE, and install zzip-config.h 
   along with the other headers, change the original
   include"config.h" in zzip-stdint.h and make it rely
   on zzip-conf.h - where zzip-conf.h includes zzip-config.h
   and lists the detected features to be used, along with most 
   important extra defs for MSVC compatibility. (!!!)
 * added AC_COMPILE_CHECK_SIZEOF (cross-compile clean!)
   to always use the correct STDINT defines. Delete
   use of glib.h if present, it's not needed anymore.
 * use ZZIP_off_t instead of off_t
 * prepare for a MSVC' ZZIP.DLL with _zzip_export defines..
   -DZZIP_DLL -> declspec(dllexport)
   -DHAVE_LIBZZIP -> declspec(dllimport)
 * make sure, __attribute__ is okay with non-gcc compilers
   and attache packed-attribute to *all* zipformat-structs. The
   whole of zzipformat.h is also enclosed in pack-pragmas.
 * -> 0.10.7
 * create zzip-config.in and install it.
 * mingw32msvc has shown that we need -lz on the command-line
   to resolve a few symbols
 * go automake
 * install zzip-config along
 * mingw32msvc does not build with cross-make.sh as seen on
   http://libsdl.org/Xmingw32 - it needs the cross-tool/lib
   just as well. There we have LDLIBADD in Makefile.mk now.
   Now everything works for making win32 target with cross-tools.
 * The rest of the make-struture should ensure to be able to
   create an MSVC nmake Makefile - the Makerule.am is clean and
   can be directly included... hopefully.
 * -> 0.10.8
 

2000-06-03 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * Tomi did a final test round for solaris, oh well,
   configure needs some fixes...
 * checking for myself at the university's solaris2.6 with
   gcc-2.95.2, hmm... there's an sys/int_types.h that
   seems to define some of C9X int-types, put it into 
   the configure.in and know about it in zzip-stdint.h
   (btw, glibc seems to have include/inttypes.h that
    includes stdint.h).
 * tomi did report a problem with gcc 2.7.2... probably
   sth. about -rpath
 * release 0.10.6 and going to announce it...

2000-05-31 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * created the main doc html files, index.html, zzip-zip.html
   and zzip-file.html. the README and README.API is deleted,
   and the TODO is a bit updated.
 * This version is meant to be announced very soon now.
 * release 0.10.5 and contact Tomi for his final nod.

2000-05-31 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * ifdef HAVE_SYS_STAT_H where stat is used. Removed
   the stats from zzip-file.h - it will now just try 
   to open the file or zip-file and assume that
   open(2) will fail if the file is not there. I do
   hereby assume that the returned fd is seekable..
 * two new functions, zzip_dir_real and zzip_file_real
   to check if the ZZIP_XX structures are wrapping a
   real file or directory. Otherwise it is a zip-archive
   or a zip-contained file respectivly.
 * zzip_compr_str does now know about stat-types and
   will return names for S_ISTYPE bits.
 * remove zzip_fd. It was identical to zzip_dirfd 
   whose name is consistent with dirent.h
 * zzip_stat -> zzip_dir_stat since it does not neither
   return a stat structure nor does it use stat(2)
 * Checking the doc-comments
   
2000-05-30 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * zzip_fp -> zzip_file and _fp_ functions to _file_
 * zzip-stdint.h to ensure iso c9x typedefs
 * ZZIP_GET16/32 macros in zzip.h header.
 * minor updates in cosmetics and documentation
 * have full replacements for dirent.h functions,
   the zip-specific functions are now called
   zip_dir_open (and more alike). The zzdir can
   now show a list of files in a real directory,
   or magically the files contained in a zip-arch.
 * release 0.10.4

2000-05-29 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * zzipmain -> zziptest and some cleanups
   in the Makefile. zziptest is now just
   another test program, so it gets compiled
   in full similarity with zzcat and zzdir.
 * removed zziptest from install-bin
 * the long forgotten simplicistic dependency
   rule is now in here too.
 * cosmetics to pointer declar' stars in 
   zziplib.h
 * ZZIP_FP -> ZZIP_FILE and
   zzip-fp.h -> zzip-file.h
 * removed the use of zzip.h where suggested
   by Tomi. (use public zziplib.h instead)
 * removed errno.h from zziplib.h
 * printing configuration at end of configure.
 * add install-includeHEADERS rule, so that
   zziplib.h does now get installed.

   
2000-05-27 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * zzipformat.h carries information about the
   zip-file structure. The typedefs are now
   used to access members of the zip-archive 
   (instead of using the offsets directly).
 * notice that the members are declared
   bytewise due to compiler semantics that is
   making a structure packed&aligned to the
   greatest common size (which would be 4).
   setting as attribute(packed) is not very
   portable.
 * reworked the files, esp. zzip-zip.c and
   zzip-ar.c
 * _USE_MMAP in autoconf, including option
   and CFLAGS setting. instead of open/read
   to a scan buffer the zip-file is mmapped
   and scanned directly.
 * _LOWSTK in autoconf, including option and
    a CFLAGS setting. Still need a scan buffer
    and this flag tells us not to carve the
    scan buffer from the auto-stack and use
    instead some malloc for the scan buffer.
 * DEBUG in autoconf, including option and
    a CFLAGS setting. The macros should now
    be able to be found everyone and only.
 * revamped EDH find routine, dumped old-style.
 * revamped read-EDH to use mmap and to use
   copy/read only for the parts we need. The
   read-EDH buffer is not limited to 32K
   anymore and can have any length. No realloc
   need anymore.
 * opendir does not allocate the cache.buf32k
   anymore - it does have no need for it. the
   buffer is still cached for subsequent Open
   calls. May want to setvbuf later.
 * a few renamings to be more bits/dirent.h-like,
   so many things are now called d_name and 
   d_reclen instead of name or next as before.
 * renamed the package to "zziplib" as being
   suggested by Tomi.
 * release 0.10.3
   
2000-05-26 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * -release at link-line for the lib
 * zzcat.c as a test program, which uncovered
     a few flaws.
 * a flaw w/_fd_opendir when being given a 
     non-inited err-return-variable and no
     error did occur.
 * the error to errno table was incomplete,
   and the ZZIP_INFLATE error is superfluous.
 * zzdir.c as a test program, needs still to
   be given the full zip-arch name.
 * changed member names of zzip_dirent to 
     match similar names in dirent and stat,
     (ie. d_name and st_size) and added furthermore
     a z_size that returns the compressed size. 
 * little updates to names and comments.
 * release 0.10.2

2000-05-22 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * merge with zip08x-0.9.6 - actually just
   a bugfix for zzip_fp_open IGNOREPATH - 
   I even applied it in a different way than
   Tomi did.
 * bugfixes for zzip_open, it did not always
   set errno(2) to the value of zzip_errno.
 * The zzip_read is now seperate from 
   zzip_fp_read, so that setting errno(2) is 
   only done in zzip_read, not in the zzip-touching
   function.
 * zzip-doc.pl to generate libzzip.html
 * release 0.10.1
   
2000-05-21 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * drop-in replacements ready for daily use,
   just use zzip_open with a normal path to
   a fs file. If that file is not found in
   a normal fs directory, then the path is
   splitted into a basepath and a filename,
   a ".zip" is appended to the basepath to
   form a zip-arch name, and the filename
   is then searched inside the zip-arch if
   that one exists. Very nice for distribution
   of a subdirectory full of scripts and that
   is what it is meant for - the PFE will be
   able to use this one for Forth-files.
 * have a VERSION file containing "0.10.0" and
   add some rules to Mk-rules
 * start with in-source docs that will be used
   for documenting the lib calls. A jdoc like
   doc extractor should be able to grok these,
   I'll see to release docs with the next
   release, but this time...
 * make it release 0.10.0 and upload it to
   pfe.sourceforge.net/pub where it will lurk
   around until I contacted Tomi. He seems to
   be currently working on zip08x

2000-05-17 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * decided to have it actually called zzip_ and so
   all of the stuff is going to get renamed again.

2000-05-16 Guido Draheim <guidod@gmx.de>
 * obtained Tomi's code and made changes so that the
   resulting library is more portable, esp. the glib
   usage is being abolished. The name of the library
   (and package) has been renamed to libunzip and
   all types, consts and funcs to now carry the unzip_
   prefix.
 * autoconf !!!!
 * drop-in functions that can be made to easily replace
   dirent and filefd functions.
