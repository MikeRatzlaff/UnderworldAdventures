uwadv \- an Ultima Underworld remake
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uwadv
.SH DESCRIPTION
Underworld Adventures is a project to recreate Ultima Underworld 1 on modern operating systems (e.g. Win32, Linux or MacOS), using the original game files. It uses OpenGL for 3D graphics, the SDL library for platform specific tasks and Lua for scripting.

Underworld Adventures needs the original game files to run, so be sure to install the game on a dos or windows partition and mount it. The game files must be all lowercase. uwadv has a tool called "ua-lowercase-all.pl" that recursively converts all file and folder names to lowercase.

Before starting the game, you have to set up the path to the installed Ultima
Underworld game files. Without them, the game won't run. Just open the file "uwadv.cfg" with a text editor (it was installed to @SHAREDPATH@) and edit the settings. To have user settings, copy the file to "~/.uwadv/uwadv.cfg" and adjust your settings in this file.

To start the Underworld Adventures, just run the executable uwadv. While running, the file "stdout.txt" is created, which contains debugging output in case of an error.

The game should behave exactly as the original. Please consult your game manuals or reference card for instructions. A list of keyboard commands for the original Ultima Underworld 1 is available in the file "uw1-keyboard.txt" that is installed to @DOCSFOLDER@.
