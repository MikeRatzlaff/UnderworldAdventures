---------------------------------

  Underworld Adventures is a project to recreate Ultima Underworld 1 on modern
  operating systems (e.g. Win32, Linux or MacOS), using the original game
  files.

Instructions
------------

  To run Underworld Adventures, you need the original Ultima Underworld game
  files (or the ones from the uw_demo), installed on your hard drive.
  Additionally, you need a 3D-accelerated graphics card and (if you want to
  hear music) an installed sound card, and of course a rather new processor.

  Before starting the game, you have to set up the path to the installed game
  files. Open the file "uwadv.cfg" that was installed with the other uwadv
  files, e.g. with Notepad. Edit the path after the word "uw1path" so that it
  points to the files. The Path should end with a backslash '\'.

  To start the Underworld Adventures, just double-click on the file
  "uwadv.exe", or use the desktop icon that was installed with the game.

In Game
-------

  In game, you can control the view of the avatar with the keyboard and the
  mouse. To move forward, press the "up" arrow of the keyboard. The other
  arrow keys move the avatar to the side ("strafe") or backward.

  To look around while standing still, left-click on the game window and drag
  the mouse into different directions.

  To change current in-game music, press the number keys '0' to '9'.

Remarks
-------

  The game currently is less than alpha, so don't expect a full game or
  features the original game has. If you want to contribute to the game,
  please visit the Underworld Adventures home page, at

    http://uwadv.sourceforge.net/

  and look at the "development" page. If you want to send mail, be it
  comments, suggestions or bug reports, just write to

  Include the keyword "uwadv" in the subject, when possible.
