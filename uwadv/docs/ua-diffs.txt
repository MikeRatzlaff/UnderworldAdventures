Underworld Adventures differences
---------------------------------

This file explains what differences between Underworld Adventures and the
original games there are. Some differences can be switched off with the
"enable-uwadv-features" set to "no" or "false". These are specially marked.

- up/down view angle can be between -75 and 75 degree, as opposed to something
  like 45 degrees in the original (can be switched off)

- cutscene speech is played back a bit too slow (as the .voc files are
  resampled to 22088 Hz as opposed to 22050 Hz)
