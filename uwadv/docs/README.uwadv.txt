Release Notes for "0.9-mojito"
---------------------------------

This release doesn't have much new things. There even are features left out.
The reason for that is a restructuring and refactoring of source code that was
done over the last few months. The release mainly was done to show that the
project is still alive and active. Expect more things to work again in the
future.

Underworld Adventures now has a (not yet complete) manual that you can read.
On Windows it is available from the "Underworld Adventures" program group. For
Linux it is installed into /usr/share/doc/uwadv-0.9_mojito/.

There is a new version of the music pack with a digitally rearranged
soundtrack for Ultima Underworld 1 available. It can be obtained from
http://uwadv.sourceforge.net/, in the download section.
