Underworld Adventures Readme File
---------------------------------

Underworld Adventures is a project to recreate Ultima Underworld 1 on modern
operating systems (e.g. Win32, Linux or MacOS), using the original game files.

Prerequisites
-------------

To run Underworld Adventures, you need the original Ultima Underworld game
files (or the ones from the Ultima Underworld Demo, "uw_demo"), installed on
your hard drive. Additionally, you need a 3D-accelerated graphics card and (if
you want to hear music) an installed sound card, and of course a rather new
processor.

Setup Paths
-----------

Before starting the game, you have to set up the path to the installed game
files. Open the file "uwadv.cfg" that was installed with the other uwadv
files, e.g. with Notepad (Windows) or vi (Linux). Edit the path after the word
"uw1path" so that it points to the game files. The Path should end with a
slash '/' or a backslash '\' (depending on the operating system).

To start the Underworld Adventures, just run the executable "uwadv.exe" (on
Windows) or "uwadv" (on Linux). While running, the two files "stdout.txt" and
"stderr.txt" are created, which may contain some messages in case of an error.

In Game
-------

The game should behave exactly as the original. Please consult your game
manuals or reference card for instructions.

Remarks
-------

The game currently is less than alpha, so don't expect a full game or
features the original game has. If you want to contribute to the game,
please visit the Underworld Adventures home page, at

and look at the "development" page. If you want to send mail, be it
comments, suggestions or bug reports, just write to

Include the keyword "uwadv" in the subject, when possible.
