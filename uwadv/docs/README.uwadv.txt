operating systems (e.g. Win32, Linux or MacOS), using the original game files.

Prerequisites
-------------

To run Underworld Adventures, you need the original Ultima Underworld game
files (or the ones from the Ultima Underworld Demo, "uw_demo"), installed on
your hard drive. Additionally, you need a 3D-accelerated graphics card and (if
you want to hear music) an installed sound card, and of course a rather new
processor.

Setup Paths
-----------

Before starting the game, you have to set up the path to the installed Ultima
Underworld game files. Without them, the game won't run.

As Windows user, just start the "Underworld Adventures Config" program that
can be found in the "Start Menu -> Programs -> Underworld Adventures". It also
is started when installing Underworld Adventures.

For advanced users or people using Linux (or other systems), just open the
file "uwadv.cfg" with a text editor (it usually is installed to
"/usr/local/share/games/uwadv/") and edit the settings manually. Operating
systems that allow a user home directory can have a file "~/.uwadv.cfg" that
supersedes settings in the global config file.

To start the Underworld Adventures, just run the executable "uwadv.exe" (on
Windows) or "uwadv" (on Linux). While running, the two files "stdout.txt" and
"stderr.txt" are created, which may contain some messages in case of an error.

In Game
-------

The game should behave exactly as the original. Please consult your game
manuals or reference card for instructions. A list of keyboard commands for
the original Ultima Underworld 1 is available in the file "uw1-keyboard.txt".

Remarks
-------

The game currently is less than alpha, so don't expect a full game or
features the original game has. If you want to contribute to the game,
please visit the Underworld Adventures home page, at

   http://uwadv.sourceforge.net/

and look at the "development" page. If you want to send mail, be it
comments, suggestions or bug reports, just write to

   vividos@users.sourceforge.net

Include the keyword "uwadv" in the subject, when possible.
