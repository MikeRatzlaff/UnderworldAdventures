    <section><title>Differences to the original game</title>
    <para>
    While creating Underworld Adventures there were some things that were
    done differently than in the original games. Reasons for this are mainly
    to simplify the game, or to implement things another way that would have
    to be much more difficult to do.
    </para>

    <para>
    Here is the list of things that are different than in Ultima Underworld 1.
    Some of the options can be switched off with the "enable-uwadv-features"
    setting in the configure file. See Section x for that.

        up/down view angle can be varied between -75 and 75 degree, as opposed
        to something like 45 degrees in the original (can be switched off).
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
      cutscene speech is played a bit too slow (due to some technical reasons
      the audio samples isn't exactly converted to the proper frequency).
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
      the input cursor in text scrolls (e.g. in conversations) is a vertical
      line, and not a blinking cursor square
