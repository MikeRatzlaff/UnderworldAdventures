1.  Introduction

The original files that came with the game are used in creating a digital
soundtrack. The original xmi had to be converted into standard mid, and
the tracks parsed according to channel. Based on that - variations
are applied and the arranegent modified, to ad accents and realism
to its performance by the synth.

The renditions are constantly modified to improve the sound. Newest
renditions are available on my website:

2. Hardware used

Pentium 4 - 1.5GHz machine with Soundblaster Audigy Platinum.
Internal Audigy synth is sometimes used for certain tracks.

3. Software used

Main synth is Yamaha S-YXG50 software MIDI emulator. Has over 600
patches accessable through its banks, fairly realistic sound, and high
polyphony.

Arrangements in Cakewalk, recording and reverb in Cool Edit, audio
compression in WinLame.

4.0 Pieces

Here, the most recent renditions of the pieces are described - their 
peculiarities, arrangements, features, etc..

4.1 Introduction Theme

Most elaborate arrangement so far. Number of instruments expanded
from 9 to 14, more specifically - Tuba, Trombone, one more Strings
section, Marimba, and a Taiko Drum. For the most part - same melodic
motifs are given to these instruments as are already played by others,
duplicating in unison, or in some cases taking over a part that originally
was played by another. In a few cases - as with taiko and marimba,
new parts are written for some sections (echo of marimba at the beginning
of tuba solo).  Strings are given a new part at the end of the piece, when
they mimic trumpet melody in canon. All used patches - Yamaha.

4.2 Dark Abyss

4.3 The Descent

Internally, the original arrangement had a flute patch set up to play
in the lower octaves that would be played by a contrabass or a tuba.
I tried to use other patches of typically low-pitched instruments, such as
a Church Organ, but... the flute just seems to work best. I HIGHLY
reccomend a good subwoofer and loud bass when you listen to this
piece - it's beauty and it's mass is in the bass.

Contrast is given to it's bass by the orchestral harp. The harp was not
bright enough to stand out against the powerful bass. I decided that
the Yamaha patch was a little too "mellow". So I recorded the harp part
played by the SB Audigy synth. The rest of the instruments were done
with Yamaha, an dthen the two parts were mixed down.

4.4 The Wanderer

In progress.
Arrangement is pretty much the same. Only patches and dynamics
modified. Brass sounds too synthetic. Expect a new rendition in the near
future.

4.12 Maps & Legends

The piece is short, simple and perfect. Almost no changes were
done to the original arrangement. More appropriate patches were
chosen.
