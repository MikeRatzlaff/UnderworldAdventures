1.  Introduction

   The original files that came with the game are used in creating a digital
   soundtrack. The original xmi had to be converted into standard mid, and
   the tracks parsed according to channel. Based on that - variations
   are applied and the arranegent modified, to ad accents and realism
   to its performance by the synth.

   The renditions are constantly modified to improve the sound. Newest
   renditions are available on my website:
      http://www.wam.umd.edu/~mshetty/music/

2. Install instructions

   The contents of the zip file has to be extracted in the "uadata" folder
   of Underworld Adventures. Please look into the installed config file
   "uwadv.cfg" where this folder is located.

   On the DOS command line or Linux shell, change into the "uadata" folder
   and unzip the whole zip file, preserving the folder structure. When using
   a zip frontend (such as Winzip, etc.), "extract" the files and specify the
   "uadata" folder as target.

   After extraction, there should be an "uw1" folder, this Readme file and a
   .m3u playlist. The playlist can be used to listen to the tracks using
   e.g. Winamp. (The playlist "music.m3u" in the uw1/audio/ folder is the
   playlist used by Underworld Adventures and cannot be used for playback).

   Note: not all pieces done are included in the digital soundtrack package.

3. Hardware used

   Pentium 4 - 1.5GHz machine with Soundblaster Audigy Platinum.
   Internal Audigy synth is sometimes used for certain tracks.

4. Software used

   Main synth is Yamaha S-YXG50 software MIDI emulator. Has over 600
   patches accessable through its banks, fairly realistic sound, and high
   polyphony.

   Arrangements in Cakewalk, recording and reverb in Cool Edit, audio
   compression in WinLame.

5.0 Pieces

   Here, the most recent renditions of the pieces are described - their 
   peculiarities, arrangements, features, etc..

5.1 Introduction Theme

   Most elaborate arrangement so far. Number of instruments expanded
   from 9 to 14, more specifically - Tuba, Trombone, one more Strings
   section, Marimba, and a Taiko Drum. For the most part - same melodic
   motifs are given to these instruments as are already played by others,
   duplicating in unison, or in some cases taking over a part that originally
   was played by another. In a few cases - as with taiko and marimba,
   new parts are written for some sections (echo of marimba at the beginning
   of tuba solo).  Strings are given a new part at the end of the piece, when
   they mimic trumpet melody in canon. All used patches - Yamaha.

5.2 Dark Abyss

   This track has yet to be done.

5.3 The Descent

   Internally, the original arrangement had a flute patch set up to play
   in the lower octaves that would be played by a contrabass or a tuba.
   I tried to use other patches of typically low-pitched instruments, such as
   a Church Organ, but... the flute just seems to work best. I HIGHLY
   reccomend a good subwoofer and loud bass when you listen to this
   piece - it's beauty and it's mass is in the bass.

   Contrast is given to it's bass by the orchestral harp. The harp was not
   bright enough to stand out against the powerful bass. I decided that
   the Yamaha patch was a little too "mellow". So I recorded the harp part
   played by the SB Audigy synth. The rest of the instruments were done
   with Yamaha, an dthen the two parts were mixed down.

5.4 The Wanderer

   In progress.
   Arrangement is pretty much the same. Only patches and dynamics
   modified. Brass sounds too synthetic. Expect a new rendition in the near
   future.

5.5 Battlefield

   This track has yet to be done.

5.6 Combat

   This track has yet to be done.

5.7 Injured

   This track has yet to be done.

5.8 Armed

   This track has yet to be done.

5.9 Victory

   This track has yet to be done.

5.10 Death

   This track has yet to be done.

5.11 Fleeing

   This track has yet to be done.

5.12 Maps & Legends

   The piece is short, simple and perfect. Almost no changes were
   done to the original arrangement. More appropriate patches were
   chosen.
