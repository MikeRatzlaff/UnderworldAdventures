.SH NAME
uwadv \- Underworld Adventures (an Ultima Underworld remake)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uwadv
.SH DESCRIPTION
Underworld Adventures is a project to recreate Ultima Underworld 1 on modern operating systems (e.g. Win32, Linux or MacOS), using the original game files. It uses OpenGL for 3D graphics, the SDL library for platform specific tasks and Lua for scripting.

Underworld Adventures needs the original game files to run, so be sure to install the game on a dos or windows partition and mount it. The game files must be all lowercase. uwadv has a tool called 
.BR "ua-lowercase-all.pl (6)"
that recursively converts all file and folder names to lowercase.

Before starting the game, you have to set up the path to the installed Ultima
Underworld game files. Without them, the game won't run. The system wide config file for Underworld Adventures can be found in
.B @UADATAPATH@uwadv.cfg
Just edit the file with a text editor. There is also the possibility to have user-specific settings and keyboard mappings. Just copy the files uwadv.cfg and keymap.cfg to the folder
.B ~/.uwadv/
and adjust the settings in these two files.

The game should behave exactly as the original. Please consult your game manuals or reference card for instructions. A list of keyboard commands for the original Ultima Underworld 1 is available in the file
.B uw1-keyboard.txt

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
While Underworld Adventures is running it produces debugging output on the console where the program was started. The output can be piped into a text file that could help the developers to track bugs and errors that can occur.
.SH BUGS
The program currently is less than alpha, so expect all sorts of bugs and missing features.
