# Underworld Adventures configuration file
#
# All settings are stored as key/value pairs. The pairs must be
# separated by at least one space. For some paths placeholders
# can be used. These are:
#
#  %uwpath%   Path of the currently played game (uw1-path or uw2-path).
#  %uadata%   Value of the "uadata-path" variable.
#  %uahome%   Path to the underworld adventures home folder. For linux
#             this is "~/.uwadv/"; For Windows versions that support per-user
#             folders, it is the "common application data folder", such as
#             "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Underworld Adventures Data\"
#             If that folder doesn't exist, the current folder is used.
#
# All placeholder variables end with a slash, so in principle it is perfectly
# valid to continue with a folder name, e.g. %uahome%uadata/. For better
# readability the slash can be repeated, though: %uahome%/uadata/
#

#
# Path to Ultima Underworld 1 folder (where the uw.exe lives)
# Underworld Demo (uw_demo) path works, too
# Note that placeholders cannot be used!
#

uw1-path @UW1PATH@

#
# Path to Ultima Underworld 2 folder (where the uw2.exe lives)
# Note that placeholders cannot be used!
# Note that this doesn't currently work with Underworld Adventures!
#

#uw2-path @UW2PATH@

#
# Path to the "uadata" folder where the *.uar files reside
# Note that the %uadata% placeholder cannot be used.
#

uadata-path @UADATAPATH@

#
# Path to a folder where the savegames are stored.
# The folder is created when it doesn't exist.
#

savegame-folder %uahome%/uasave/

#
# Path to a custom keymap to load.
