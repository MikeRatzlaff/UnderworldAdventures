            <h1>News archive</h1>

            <p>
                Here are listed older news bits that were once on the main news page. They are
                here for history purposes; note that some links may be outdated.
            </p>

            <h3>2006-04-17 - Project status</h3>

            <p>
                As some ask about the status of Underworld Adventures and if it's abandoned, I
                thought I post a new project news item to give a status update of the project.
            </p>

            <p>
                The current release is the 0.9 release from two years ago. There was some work in
                CVS until the end of 2005, including a Mac OS X port, but nothing releaseable. In
                the beginning of 2006 I decided to rewrite the game, using the algorithms and
                functions already in uwadv. Until now I've rewritten about 20% of the classes in
                uwadv. Additonally unit tests were added for every class in uwadv, to ensure code
                stability.
            </p>

            <p>
                I expect that I have something releaseable by the end of the year (2006, that
                is!), but until then there won't be any releases that can be tried out. For an
                alpha version of the game, try out the latest release:
                <a href="download.html">0.9 "mojito"</a>.
            </p>

            <hr size="1" width="80%" />

            <h3>2004-10-12 - Developer Log updated; RSS feed available</h3>

            <p>
                I updated the <a href="http://uwadv.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=devlog">"devlog"</a> with some of the recent
                ongoings on the uwadv project. I also added some screenshots of the new Underworld
                Adventures Debugger I'm currently working on. And the Underworld Adventures
                Developer Log got a RSS 2.0 feed recently. So if you want to be up-to-date, just
                add the feed to your favourite aggregator. If there's a problem with the feed,
                just drop me a mail.

            <h3>2004-04-23 - debian package for uwadv 0.9 "mojito" released</h3>

            <p>
                Today the debian package for the 0.9 version was released. The packages were
                prepared for Debian/testing (the package should work for unstable, too). Grab it
                on the <a href="download.html">download page</a>.
            </p>

            <hr size="1" width="80%" />

            <h3>2004-04-10 - new release: uwadv 0.9 "mojito"</h3>

            <p>
                I'm happy to announce that after *mumble,mumble* months, we have released a new
                version of Underworld Adventures!<sup>[1]</sup>. This release codenamed after the
                cuban national drink doesn't have new features added. In fact it misses some
                features that were present in 0.8, but the source code was heavily restructured
                and refactored. Source code and binaries for Windows and Linux are available on
                the <a href="download.html">download page</a>. From now on releases will
                be done more frequently. It is planned to have a release at least every 2 months.
            </p>

            <p>
                We also released a new version of the digital music soundtrack pack that contains
                the 2 new and unreleased tracks "Wanderer" and "Maps &amp; Legends" from Martin
                Gircys-Shetty (QQtis). The package is also available on the
                <a href="download.html">download page</a>. Thanks Martin!
            </p>

            <p>
                The project always searches for people to help out coding, porting and testing. We
                especially search for someone who ports the code to Mac OS X. Also some artwork is
                needed for the splash screen and a new installer. Please see the
                <a href="development.html">development</a> section for more information.
            </p>

            <p>
                We also wish the Underworld Adventures a happy 2nd birthday anniversary! Two years
                ago I got the mail from SourceForge that my project is approved. Although readers
                of the <a href="http://uwadv.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=devlog">dev log</a> know that the idea of the
                project emerged earlier, it's nevertheless a good date to release a new version.
                So enjoy this release!
            </p>

            <h3>2003-11-17 - code restructuring</h3>
            <p>
                For those of you who keep reloading the uwadv page for months and not a single new
                release - the project is not dead! In fact there's some major code restructuring
                going on in the depths of CVS. This gives me the chance to keep the source code
                structured and maintainable when uwadv is expanding its features. If you're
                interested in the technical details, head over to the
                <a href="http://uwadv.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=devlog">developer's log</a>
                where the daily ongoings are logged.

            <h3>2003-04-30 - debian package released</h3>
            <p>
                Today the first debian binary package is released. In the future both RPM and
                Debian packages will be released to the Linux community.
            </p>

            <hr size="1" width="80%" />

            <h3>2003-04-29 - bugfix release</h3>
            <p>
                Made another release to fix some bugs in the game. A Win32 binary is available.
                Sourcecode can be obtained via CVS, the release tag is hot_chili_08a.
            </p>

            <hr size="1" width="80%" />

            <h3>2003-04-24 - It's getting hot!</h3>
            <p>
                Another release, this time named "hot chili"! Here's the list of new things in
                Underworld Adventures:
            </p>

            <p>
                * added simple NPC animation<br />
                * added picking up items from the underworld<br />
                * added animated lava and water textures<br />
                * added switches, levers and pull chains<br />
                * implemented some traps and triggers<br />
                * added bridges<br />
                * added savegames loading/saving<br />
                * added quicksave functionality<br />
                * fixed 3d models sizes
            </p>

            <h3>2003-04-02 - April fools joke</h3>
            <p>
                For those that really thought the yesterday's news bit was real: it really was an
                april fools joke. The source of the games (according to Doug Church) probably is
                lost. If you want to read the posted text, just

            <h3>2003-02-13 - Underworld Walkthrough</h3>
            <p>
                Today I noticed that <a href="http://www.sircabirus.com/" target="_blank">Sir Cabirus</a>
                finished his <a href="http://www.sircabirus.com/uw1walk/pages/index.html" target="_blank">Ultima Underworld 1 Walkthrough</a>
                which helps greatly to replay the game. Good work, Sir Cabirus!

            <h3>2003-02-11 - Muffin ... Yummy!</h3>
            <p>
                Release names are getting worse :) ... Today's release features initial
                conversation support (no inventory interaction yet), support for 3d models for
                static objects (some models from Sam Matthews are included) and usage of big
                textures larger than 256x256 is removed, which should help Voodoo3 card users. The
                digital music pack of course still works with this release.
            </p>

            <h3>2003-01-03 - uwadv-devel list changes</h3>
            <p>
                It is now required to be subscribed to send mails to the list. This change was
                necessary to protect list members from unsolicited mails sent to the list.

            <h3>2002-11-21 - Serving "rotworm stew"</h3>
            <p>
                This release of Underworld Adventures (named "rotworm stew") has a lot of new
                features inside: Looking at objects in the underworld was added, NPC and critter
                sprites are rendered now (no animation yet), added mouse movement, custom key
                mappings, visiting more of the underworld (via some cheat keys), a rewritten
                collision detection and fixed midi playback and manual pages for Linux.
            </p>

            <p>
                Martin Shetty started to rearrange the underworld soundtrack for Underworld
                Adventures in digital form, and a music pack is ready to try out. As always, there
                is the source package, the Linux binary RPM and a nice Windows installer with
                config program. Just head over to the <a href="download.html">downloads</a>.

            <h3>2002-10-07 - We're not vapourware</h3>
            <p>
                No, the project is not dead, there is just nothing really worth to show in a new
                release. Meanwhile development goes on with internal things like Lua scripting and
                resource file decoding. If you want to know what happens on the project, just read
                the <a href="http://uwadv.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=devlog">"dev log"</a> or

            <p>
                The Underworld Adventures Team currently searches for a 3d modeler to join. Fans
                of the Ultima Underworld game series are especially welcome. The ingame 3d models
                should replace the objects, NPCs and monster sprites for the "enhanced" user
                interface of the game. Details can be discussed per mail

            <p>
                This new release called "poppypastry" is a big step forward. uwadv now has the
                intro splash screens, the game's menu (although, only "Journey Onward" works),
                collision detection and the Underworld is darker now. Some bugs are still in,
                happy bug chasing!

                Made a new release, "grainroll". Tools now contain the uw1 conversation script
                decompiler and an animation viewer for the uw1 cutscenes (tools can be found in
                the binary release). For the main program, the abyss now has objects, and textures
                are rendered correctly. uwadv should work on Linux and MacOS X, too.

            <h3>2002-05-22 - Tools released</h3>
            <p>
                Some tools for Ultima Underworld are available now, as win32 binaries. There's a
                level map display program, a uw1 conversation script debugger and a little tool to
                convert the xmi midi files to ordinary midis. All available at the

            <h3>2002-05-05 - First alpha release</h3>
            <p>
                I released first working alpha version of Underworld Adventures. The release is
                called 'ricecraeker' (why this is so? read about it in the
                <a href="download.html">download</a> section :-). It lets you run through the
                first level of the abyss (no wall collision detection, though).
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course I search for more people willing to help with the project. For more,

            <p>
                I redesigned the Underworld Adventures project home page today (looks a bit like
                the Ultima Underworld 1 handbook). Work on the game framework continues, and soon
                a first build can be downloaded.

            <h3>2002-04-11 - Project home page started</h3>
            <p>
                SourceForge project page was set up today, so development can start. Sources will
                be checked in soon.
