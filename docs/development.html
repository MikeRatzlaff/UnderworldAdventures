            <h1>Development</h1>

            <p>
                Welcome to the Underworld Adventures development section!
            </p>

            <p>
                The Underworld Adventures source code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/vividos/UnderworldAdventures">GitHub</a>.
                More infos about the source code can be found there. If you want to submit a bug
                report, you can use the Github project's
                <a href="https://github.com/vividos/UnderworldAdventures/issues">issue tracker</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                A <a href="devlog.html">Developer's log</a> is available that has log entries of
                what happened with the project so far.

            <h2>Plans</h2>

            <p>
                The plan for the project was to bring Ultima Underworld 1 to modern operating
                systems, by implementing the engine and the game logic. After that the project
                would try to support the more complex Ultima Underworld 2. Finally the idea was to
                create a game development studio to create new games in the style of the Ultima
                Underworlds.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nowadays you can play uw1 and uw2 easily using Dosbox, and you still can get it
                from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/ultima_underworld_1_2">gog.com</a>. This
                project still is up for these two goals:
                <ul>
                    <li>to keep and provide the history of game development for uwadv</li>
                    <li>to showcase what the project has reached at this point</li>
                </ul>

                I occasinally will work on the Underworld Adventures code, in order to improve my
                C++ and graphics programming skills and to dig into and hack the original game
                files. You're welcome to join!
            </p>

            <h2>uwadv-devel mailing list archive</h2>

            <p>
                Back in the days there was an active mailing list "uwadv-devel". The archives
                still can be found here:
                <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/uwadv/mailman/uwadv-devel/">uwadv-devel mailing list archive</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>#uwadv IRC channel</h2>
            <p>
                The project has a (once lively) official IRC channel. Just connect to irc.freenode.net
                and join #uwadv. wjp's chatbot 'exultbot' still collects and hosts the archive,
                here: <a href="http://log.usecode.org/uwadvlog.php?log=toc">#uwadv logs</a>.
                Exultbot also understands some commands. Just say "?help" in the channel to get an
                overview of the commands.
